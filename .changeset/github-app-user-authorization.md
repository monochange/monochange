# Use GitHub App user authorization for repository onboarding

Configure the GitHub App callback as `https://monochange.dev/auth/callback` and store its client ID and client secret in the `monochange_app` production profile. Login now uses PKCE and an exact callback URI, installation state is bound to the initiating browser, and expiring GitHub user tokens are refreshed from credentials stored by the new database migration.
