# Verify repository changes through the dashboard

The native SSR regression suite now delivers signed GitHub installation and repository-selection webhooks through the real API router, reloads the dashboard, and verifies additions, removals, suspension, uninstall and isolation between accounts. A second journey checks that organization repositories disappear when the installer loses ownership, and expired GitHub authorization shows a retry/sign-in state instead of an empty workspace. Only GitHub's external responses are replaced; cookies, SQLite, webhook signature verification and rendering stay real.
