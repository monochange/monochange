# Choose release-note streams by audience for every package type

Generated release-agent instructions and the bundled skill now require agents to read configured stream and type descriptions and inspect output destinations before writing changesets. Application packages can use developer types for deployment or CI changes and product types for visible behavior. Agents create separate notes for the same package only when both audiences need them, then preview and render each output for review.

Use `monochange subagents <target> --force` to refresh an existing generated agent definition. Review local edits before replacing it. Inspect each audience with `monochange notes --output <id> --target <package>`; notes with a selected stream still need human or agent review of their prose.

The website now retains operational notes in `app/developer-changelog.md` instead of putting them in its public feed. Its implicit default changelog remains disabled. A named default-stream output retains those entries alongside the existing website outputs:

```toml
[changelog.outputs.website_developer]
stream = "default"
targets = ["monochange_app"]
path = "app/developer-changelog.md"
format = "keep_a_changelog"
mode = "append"
```
