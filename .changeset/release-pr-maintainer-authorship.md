# Use the maintainer identity for automated release pull requests

The repository's release workflow now opens release pull requests with the same existing maintainer token used to prepare their commits. Previously, the separate bot token made GitHub choose `github-actions[bot]` as the author of the queued squash commit and add the maintainer as a co-author.

The workflow now uses `RELEASE_PR_MERGE_TOKEN` for both operations. No new credential or permission is required. Existing bot-authored release pull requests must be replaced under the maintainer account before merging when sole maintainer authorship is required; changing the token does not change their author.
